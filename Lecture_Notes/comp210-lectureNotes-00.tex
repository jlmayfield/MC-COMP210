What you need to know about this set of lecture notes.
\end{abstract}

These lecture notes are for the fourth course in computer science offered at Monmouth College.  This course cherry picks material from a wide array of online resources and this set of notes.  As such, these notes aim to be the overall glue for course.  When the subject matter being discussed is the contents of a text or online resource, then these notes are meant to accompany that source, not replace it.  They're written from the perspective of hindsight and meant to guide reflection and analysis of the reading\sidenote{so go do the reading}. 
Finally, these notes are in a perpetual draft state. As such, typos and errors are to be expected. Reader be warned. Students are welcome to correct typos in the \LaTeX\ and submit a pull request to the main repository. Doing so gives you practice in \LaTeX\ , Git, Github, and may result in extra credit.
