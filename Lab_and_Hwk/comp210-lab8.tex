\begin{abstract}
In this lab you'll analyze and the MVC design for our Celsius converter program that we walked through in class.
\end{abstract}

\section{Lab 8}

The goal for lab is to do a thorough UML diagram for this program in order to road map the MVC design and the associated Java libraries. Every method called\sidenote{both user written and library provided} must be accounted for. If a method is overridden from a library, then place it two places in your diagram: where it's overridden and where it originated. If a method is provided by a library, then include that library class and method in your diagram. When methods are inherited then include as much of the class hierarchy as needed to attributed the method to its originating class. Methods that come from interfaces should be listed both in the originating interface and the class that implements it.

\section{Homework 7}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Due by class time on Wednesday}
\end{center}

For homework you recapture the grid-like layout of the original programming using something other than the GroupLayout of the original program.
